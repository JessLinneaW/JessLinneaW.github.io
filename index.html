                                        Through the course of my time as a content creator at Art of Where, I was responsible for all visual
                                        content on our website and social media platforms. Creating content varied from photographing 
                                        products at home in a more "studio photography" style, to lifestyle shoots, and even filming and
                                        editing video content. Often times I not only created the content, but also modelled in it as deadlines
                                        tended to be tight. Another key content responsibility of mine was blogging: I would both write our
                                        frequent blog posts as well as organize all necessary vidual content.</p>

                                        As the head of marketing at both Art Fabrics and Art of Where, I worked directly with company owners
                                        to create digital advertising. Advertising campeigns were created to promote individual products and
                                        larger promotions and sales. My role involved brainstorming ads and pitching them to the owners.
                                        Once an ad was chosen I was responsible for creating all visual and written content. Our ads, which 
                                        consisted of both still images and videos, generally ran on social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, 
                                        though we experimented with Google advertising as well.</p>
